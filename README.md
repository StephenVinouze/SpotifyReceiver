# SpotifyReceiver
A demo project to demonstrate how to listen to Spotify events from your own Android app

## Requirements
To get events from the Spotify app, you must have the application running on your phone as well as activating broadcast from the Settings panel by turning ON *Device Broadcast Status*.
